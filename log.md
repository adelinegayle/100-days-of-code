# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 1, 2021

**Today's Progress**: I created my personal implementation of Arrays using Javascript. I also used the TDD approach by writing tests first before the actual code.

**Thoughts** There are still lots of things to learn. Need to familiarize the concepts written [here](https://ui.dev/beginners-guide-to-javascript-prototype/) and [here](https://ui.dev/creating-your-own-array/)

### Day 2-3: September 3-4, 2021

**Today's Progress**: I wrote an API in NodeJS that scrapes quotes and author details from a dummy website (https://quotes.toscrape.com/). Libraries that I used are express (a web framework) and cheerio (a library for scraping web pages)

**Thoughts** The code works but it is not written in an optimal way. Sometimes, it would take more that 10 seconds for the API to render data. I need to do research on how to optimize the code.
