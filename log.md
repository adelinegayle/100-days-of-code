# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 1, 2021

**Today's Progress**: I created my personal implementation of Arrays using Javascript. I also used the TDD approach by writing tests first before the actual code.

**Thoughts** There are still lots of things to learn. Need to familiarize the concepts written [here](https://ui.dev/beginners-guide-to-javascript-prototype/) and [here](https://ui.dev/creating-your-own-array/)
